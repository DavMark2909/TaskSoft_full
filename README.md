🚀 Key Features

- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Dynamic UI rendering that distinguishes between "Standard" and "Manager" views based on JWT claims. 
- Centralized Security: Implements a custom OAuth2 Authorization Server to manage user identities and security protocols. 
- Dual-Association Task Logic: Sophisticated data modeling that separates task creators (assigners) from executors (assignees). 
- Collaborative Group Workflows: Support for many-to-many user-group memberships, allowing tasks to be assigned to functional teams (e.g., DevOps, Frontend).
